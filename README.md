# XGONET

A Social Network built with `go`.

### Configuration

Current version used for the development of the application is go1.11.4 but it would probably be compatible with any version >= go1.11.X 


### Project Requirements

1. The program will use mock data at startup.
2. The program will use a flag "username1" and "username2" to determine if the 2 usernames are connected via their friend list.
3. The program will output how much time it took to determine if the 2 usernames are connected and how many users it had to traverse to find the answer.
4. Include any kind of automated tests.
